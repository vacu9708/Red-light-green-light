Squid game was very popular recently. In the series, the game called Red light, green light appears. It's a thrilling and simple game. I got interested and wanted to make a video game of it to improve my C++ skills. This is my 3rd C++ project. I tried to stick to the Single Responsibility Principle in this project.

## ⚒️Skills used

## 🥅Your goal in this game
* You have to get to the finish line before time's up without getting caught by the robot.

## Game rule, features

* You have to repeatedly press the arrow key on the keyboard as fast as you can to move faster because you can't move holding down the key.
* You have some competitors.
