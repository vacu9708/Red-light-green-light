# 🚥Red-light-green-light (Squid game)
Squid game was very popular recently. In the series, the game called Red light, green light appears. It's a thrilling and simple game. I got interested and wanted to make a video game of it to improve my C++ skills. This is my 3rd C++ project. I tried to stick to the Single Responsibility Principle in this project.
